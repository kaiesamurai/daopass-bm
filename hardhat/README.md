### Introduction
BlockPass is a decentralized platform built on the Scroll blockchain, designed to address the challenges of traditional event ticketing systems. By leveraging blockchain technology and NFTs, BlockPass ensures fair ticket pricing, prevents scalping, and guarantees the authenticity of event tickets.

### Usage
#### Creating a New Pass
To create a new pass on BlockPass, organizers can follow these steps:

1. Connect your Scroll wallet to the BlockPass platform.
2. Navigate to the "Create New Pass" section.
3. Fill in the details of the pass, including maximum pass count, start time, sales end time, initial pass price, metadata, and category.
4. Confirm the creation of the pass, and it will be deployed on the blockchain.

#### Purchasing a Pass
To purchase a pass on BlockPass as an attendee, follow these steps:

1. Connect your Scroll wallet to the BlockPass platform.
2. Browse the available passes and select the desired pass.
3. Review the pass details, including pricing and availability.
4. Click "Purchase Pass" and confirm the transaction using your wallet.
5. Upon successful purchase, the pass will be minted as an NFT in your wallet.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Prices of passes are dynamically adjusted based on real-time market conditions using Chainlink price feeds.
- **Fair Access:** Unique NFT-based passes prevent scalping and ensure fair access for genuine fans.
- **Immutable Records:** All ticket transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing fraud.

### Chainlink Integration
BlockPass integrates Chainlink price feeds to enable dynamic pricing of event passes. The `updateFeedPrice` function in the smart contract retrieves real-time asset prices from Chainlink oracles and adjusts the pass price accordingly. This ensures that pass prices remain fair and reflect current market conditions.

### The Graph Protocol Integration
BlockPass utilizes the Graph Protocol for efficient indexing and querying of blockchain data. The BlockPass subgraph indexes data related to event passes, including pass details, transaction history, and user interactions. Users can query the subgraph to retrieve information such as available event passes, pass prices, user bookings, and more, facilitating seamless interaction with the BlockPass platform.
